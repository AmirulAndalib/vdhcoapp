# DownloadHelper CoApp

*DownloadHelper CoApp* is a multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) application
providing the [Video DownloadHelper](https://downloadhelper.net/)
browser add-on with a set of extra features not available directly
from the add-on:

- file writing API
- launching default video player application on a data file
- a build of the [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) video converter

*DownloadHelper CoApp* complies with the
[native messaging protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)
and is not intended to be used directly from the command line.

Installer executables for the various platforms are available
from the [releases page](https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp/releases).

# Installation

**Windows**: download the `.exe` file, double click on it, and follow the instructions.

**Mac**: download the `.pkg` file, double click on it, and follow the instructions.

**Linux debian-based**: download the `.deb` file and install it: `sudo dpkg -i <deb file>`.

**Linux other**: download the `.tar.bz2` file, unpack and move to a desired location, and run `./vdhcoapp install`.

At this point, the app should be recognised within your browser.

# Alternative installation methods

**Mac DMG**: download the `.dmg` file, open it and move the app to **Application** folder.
Launch the app once to register its manifest within the different browsers (it will show
a notification then close). Re-run the app if you ever move the application to a new location.

**Linux tar.bz2**: download the `.tar.bz2` file, extract it where ever you want to
install the app, then run `<install location>/vdhcoapp install` to register the
manifest within the different browsers. Re-run the install command if you ever move
the application to a new location.

# Troubleshooting

If the coapp is not recognised by the extension, here are a few things you can try:

- restart your browser
- make sure the Video DownloadHelper addon is at least version 8, and has been installed from its official location: https://www.downloadhelper.net/install
- on Mac, double click on the coapp, this should re-register the app in the relevant browsers.
- on Linux, run `/opt/vdhcoapp/vdhcoapp install` to re-register the app. And Look at the note below about Flatpak and Snap browsers.

If you are comfortable with the command line, move to the installation folder of the coapp, and run: `./vdhcoapp --info`. It will run some diagnostic operations.

# Notes about Flatpak browsers

**Firefox**: it should work out of the box.

**Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Brave, â€¦)**: if the coapp is not visible from your browser, you can trigger the coapp flatpak registration with: `vdhcoapp install`.

# Notes about Snap browsers

**Firefox**: it should work out of the box.

Snap Chromium-based browsers do not support native messaging yet. It is up to Google to fix this issue.

# Note about the registration process

After the app is installed, the coapp installs a json file into browser-specific directories,
as described by the Mozilla, Google and Microsoft documentation:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/nativeMessaging/#native-messaging-host-location
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/native-messaging?tabs=v3%2Cwindows

You can see the list of files installed by running the app with the argument `sudo vdhcoapp install`
(if installed as a root user) and `vdhcoapp install --user` (if installed as non-root user).
Those files can be remove with `vdhcoapp uninstall [--user]`.

# Note about Linux 32 bits architecture

The coapp application is based on *node.js* and coapp v2.x.x is specifically based on *node.js 18*. Unfortunately,
*node.js* has dropped support for Linux 32 bits since *node.js 12*. As a consequence, the VDH companion app in versions 2.x.x does not offer binaries for Linux 32 bits anymore.

You can still use the <a href="https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp/releases/tag/v1.6.3">companion app version 1.6.3</a> as the VDH addon remains compatible with older coapp versions, but some newest features might be missing.

An alternative if you are a developer: you may want to consider compiling *node.js 18* for 32 bits and rebuild the coapp with it. On our side, we cannot release publicly a binary based on an unsupported version of *node.js*.
