# DownloadHelper CoApp - Troubleshooting

If the coapp is not recognised by the extension, here are a few things you can try:

- Try the latest coapp. You will find the download links [here](https://www.downloadhelper.net/install-coapp-v2).
- If you use Edge, make sure to install the addon from the Microsoft store, not the Google store. See relevant links [here](https://www.downloadhelper.net/install).

## If you're reporting an issue, please read this first

Make sure to read this document thoroughly. The answer of your problem is most likely in here. If you can't find a solution to your problem, please report it, and include these information:

If the app is not recognized:

- The browser you're using (be as specific as possible)
- OS (Linux/Windows/Mac) & OS version
- OS 64bits or 32bits
- Link to the coapp you installed
- On Mac, the output of `/Applications/net.downloadhelper.coapp.app/Contents/MacOS/vdhcoapp --info`
- On Windows, open a CMD shell, go to the install directory, and type `./vdhcoapp.exe --info`
- On Linux, your sandbox mechanism (if any): flatpak/snap/â€¦
- On Linux, the output of `/opt/vdhcoapp/vdhcoapp --info`

If the download video is not valid or missing audio:

- version of Video DownloadHelper addon
- link to the page with the video

## Windows CoApp not found by extension

Make sure you use Windows 64 bits, with Firefox 64 bits, with CoApp 64 bits, or
Windows 32 bits, with Firefox 32 bits, with CoApp 32 bits.

You can check where the CoApp registered its manifests. Run these commands in a `CMD` prompt:

For 64 bits system:

```
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\net.downloadhelper.coapp
```

For a 32 bits system:

```
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\net.downloadhelper.coapp
```

If this returns nothing, something was wrong during the coapp installation process.

If this returns something, but it doesn't point to an existing file, re-install the CoApp.

If this return something, and it does point to an existing file, your Firefox might be using
the wrong architecture.

## Windows Antivirus

It's possible that your Antivirus blocks the CoApp. Sadly, Antivirus can be overly protective. Our application is OpenSource, and not malicious in any way, you can look at the source code [right here](https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp). Video Downloadhelper has been validated by Google, Microsoft and Mozilla organizations. We recommend either:

- using the [Microsoft Antivirus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security) - it is free and [recommended by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/why-use-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide);
- or allowing the CoApp (you'll need to allow the 3 ".exe" files located in the installation directory).

## Windows Installation Error

If you're getting an error during installation, try installing after closing your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge).

## Windows 7

We have dedicated builds for Windows 7. You will find the download links [here](https://www.downloadhelper.net/install-coapp-v2). **Make sure to install the Windows 7 version** (_vdhcoapp-xxx-win7-x86_64-installer.exe_).

## Mac

After install, start the coapp (only one time after intallation), this should re-register the app in the relevant browsers.
If you use an old version of MacOS, [see this](https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp/issues/190).

## Ubuntu (and Flatpak / Snap based systems)

Most of the time, the issue is a missed prompt. Firefox should have showed you a prompt to allow the coapp to communicate with the extension. Some people miss the prompt, or the prompt just never shows up. There's no user interface to change that setting. To solve this, run these commands (even if you don't use Flatpak):

```
sudo apt-get install -y flatpak
flatpak permission-set webextensions net.downloadhelper.coapp snap.firefox yes
```

## Firejail-based systems

See this [comment](https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp/issues/189#issuecomment-1888447688).

## KDE Neon (and AppArmor based systems)

Add `/opt/vdhcoapp/vdhcoapp ux,` to `/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.firefox`.

Then restart *apparmor.service* and *Firefox*.

## Linux (all)

- Run `/opt/vdhcoapp/vdhcoapp install` (**not as root! Don't use sudo**) to re-register the app.
- Move to the installation folder of the coapp in your terminal, and run: `/opt/vdhcoapp/vdhcoapp --info`. It will run some diagnostic operations.
- do not install vdhcoapp within the `/usr/` directory, it won't be detected by your browser. [See here why](https://github.com/aclap-dev/vdhcoapp/issues/160#issuecomment-1780765719).
- **Snap Chromium-based browsers**: they do not support native messaging yet. It is up to Google to fix this issue.
